## Overview:
Users for this API are other developers. The API stores an image, does image recognition on it and returns results to the user with a GET endpoint.

## Workflow:
- Send a `POST` request. Response return unique `upload_url`.
- The user uploads a picture to the `upload_url.`
- Once the image has been `PUT` to the `upload_url`, it gets stored in an **S3 bucket**. Once successfully stored, this will trigger the image recognition process.
- Using **AWS Rekognition** for image recognition process. 
- Once the image recognition process finishes, the user can retrieve the results from a `GET` endpoint.

### TODO:
- The API stores an image, does image recognition on it and returns results to the user in two ways, with a **callback** and a GET endpoint.
- Send request with **optionally provided ``callback_url``** in request body. Response return unique upload_url.
- Once the image recognition process finishes, the user receives a callback under the **``callback_url``** they indicated in the first step.

## Usage
This project uses [`serverless`](https://www.serverless.com/) framework âš¡. So, make sure you get that first and give the necessary permissions to `serverless cli`. Follow [this page](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) for getting started. <br>
